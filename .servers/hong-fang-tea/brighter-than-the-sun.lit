Brighter than the Sun

When people think about the corporations that dominate the East, they typically think of KuaiGong International, which holds a complete monopoly for manufacturing and commerce in Asia, or Global Pharmaceuticals, the world's largest drug company, or OmniTek Incorporated, the global leader in intelligent and autonomous robots. But there's one company that has seen a rapid rise in the last year and is poised to dominate not only the East, but the entire world: TaiYang Digital.

TaiYang Digital is a Chinese internet-technology corporation that provides services such as online advertising, search engines, gaming, media, entertainment, and cloud computing/storage. Its name TaiYang comes from the Chinese word for 'sun'. In Chinese culture, the sun is a 'yang' symbol associated with life, heat, masculinity, and heaven.

The company was founded less than 5 years ago and is already the third highest valued company in all of Asia. In 2076 it generated a total revenue of over 10 trillion yuan. Its services are used daily by over a billion people worldwide.

TaiYang Digital's meteoric rise is extremely surprising in modern society. This sort of growth is something you'd commonly see in the first half of the century, especially for tech companies. However in the last two decades the number of corporations has significantly declined as the largest entities quickly took over the economy. Corporations such as ECorp, MegaCorp, and KuaiGong International have established such strong monopolies in their market sectors that they have effectively killed off all of the smaller and new corporations that have tried to start up over the years. This is what makes the rise of TaiYang Digital so impressive. And if TaiYang continues down this path, then they have a bright future ahead of them.
