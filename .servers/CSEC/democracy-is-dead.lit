Democracy is Dead: The Fall of an Empire

They rose from the shadows in the street.
From the places where the oppressed meet.
Their cries echoed loudly through the air.
As they once did in Tiananmen Square.
Loudness in the silence, Darkness in the light.
They came forth with power and might.
Once the beacon of democracy, America was first.
Its pillars of society destroyed and dispersed.
Soon the cries rose everywhere, with revolt and riot.
Until one day, finally, all was quiet.
From the ashes rose a new order, corporatocracy was its name.
Rome, Mongol, Byzantine, all of history is just the same.
For man will never change in a fundamental way.
And now democracy is dead, in the USA.
